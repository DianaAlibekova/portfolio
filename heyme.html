        <h2>"HeyMe" brand | 2020</h2>
            <p>The brand "HeyMe" is directed to popularize the Kazakh identity through digital art. The designs on the T-shirts include the visuals created through digital drawings and Photoshop and the written materials connected to them, which convey wise Kazakh phrases, my unique word games, and Abai's (The great Kazakh poet) poems, and wise thoughts. </p>
            <br>
            <p>Because of the limited possibilities of printing in Astana, it was possible to print the digital material on white and black t-shirts only. Because of this, the brand is focused on materializing the creative idea in these two colors.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Her favorite t-shirt design is called "Moonayma" which is the word game because "Moonayma" in Kazakh means "don't be sad" as well as "Moon ay ma?" means "Is a moon a moon in Kazakh". The phrase on the bottom of the drawing "Moon bolsa armanyn, sen aiga da usharsyn" means "If you dream of the moon, you can reach it too". The inspirational little quote done by Diana is followed by her drawings of the cosmonaut on the moon. </p>
